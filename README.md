This repository is my first solo work with Angular using an API. I followed a guide set up by RAONI BOAVENTURA on toptal.com (http://www.toptal.com/angular-js/a-step-by-step-guide-to-your-first-angularjs-app).

He utilized an API for Formula 1 racing. I followed his guidance without any additional help. I completed the project in one afternoon and encountered only a few minor problems toward the end (i.e. typing URL instead of Url). Raoni stripped out all CSS from his project. I added a few minor CSS items in before uploading this, but decided to upload my work so far and spend more time on the CSS later on.
